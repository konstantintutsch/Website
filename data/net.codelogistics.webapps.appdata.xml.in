    <p>
      Install websites as desktop apps, so that they appear in their own windows separate from any browsers installed.
      Links to websites other than the one installed open in a new browser window.

      This is similar to the &quot;Install as App&quot; feature found in popular web browsers.
      It uses the WebKit engine which is also used by GNOME Web and Safari, so most websites are likely to run without issues.
